<p>Welcome to my site!</p>

</p>

<p>I made the site my name so I think we've got that covered so where to start... I'm 23 yrs old right now and based in NJ.</p>

<p>I went to <i>the </i> University of Michigan and studied Industrial and Operations Engineering a.k.a lots of math, ergonomics, and supply chain stuff (it was awesome).</p>

<p>I've tried my best to adopt a "growth mindset": Individuals who believe their talents can be developed through hard work, good strategies, and input from others. </p>

<p>This mindset has helped me to dive deeper into my hobbies, try new things that may have seemed impossible, and meet amazing people.</p>

<p>In the past, this has helped me to... </p>
<p>Write a book </p>    
<p><img src = me5.jpg class = "image"></p>

<p>Currently it's helped me to...</p>
<p>Build this website, which is constantly evolving as I learn more about coding from google and my computer science friends from school.</p>

<p>Build an acoustic guitars in Cape Cod with my cousin. </p>
<p><img src = guitar.jpg class = "image"> </p>

<p>Some of my other hobbies/passions include...</p>
<p>Traveling</p>
<p>Smells! (Cologne)</p>
<p>Running</p>
<p>Music (piano, guitar, tenor sax)</p>
